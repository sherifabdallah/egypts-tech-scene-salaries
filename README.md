# Egypts tech scene salaries
Egypt's tech market is a bit vague. You can't access information regarding salaries, popular technologies, and companies' environment without finding yourself having to get in contact with employees working inside the company. Famous reviews websites like Glassdoor aren't much of a help since most employees don't disclose their salaries even anonymously and only angry employees decide to write reviews on Glassdoor.
This unintelligibility makes anyone who wants to value themselves in the market fail to do so. A lot of people often ask me: Which technologies should we learn to increase our chances in the market? Or how much should I ask for? And so on. While it's true that some companies are technology agnostic when it comes to hiring where they test you in your Problem Solving and Design skills, most companies, in Egypt, favour hiring someone who is already comfortable with their tech stack.
